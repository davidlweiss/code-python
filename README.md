## Projects Completed

#### Unit 2 - Strings and Console Output

* Project: Madlibs (Madlibs.py)
  * Description: A Madlibs word game that prompts user for a series of inputs. Inputs are placed into a sample short story. 

#### Unit 3 - Conditionals and Control Flow

* Project: PygLatin (pyglatin.py)
  * Description: prompts user to input a word, and subsequently translates it into Pig Latin. 

* Project: Area Calculator (areacalculator.py)
  * Description: a calculator that computes the area of selected shapes. Prompts user to selects shape, calculates the area of that shape, and prints it to console. 
  
#### Unit 4 - Functions

* Project: Number Guess (numberguess.py)
  * Description:  rolls a pair of dice and asks the user to guess the sum. If the user's guess is equal to the total value of the dice roll, the user wins...otherwise, the computer wins.
  * Functionality: 
    * Prompts a user for input as to how many sides (1-6) on each dice they'd like to play with. 
    * Computes the maximum value possible based on the number of sides chosen. 
    * Prompts a user to guess the sum of the 2 dice "rolled"; if user makes a guess higher than the maximum value, the prompt persists.
    * "Rolls" 2 dice by randomly selecting a number between 1 and the number of sides chosen using the randint function.
    * Outputs a congratulatory statement if the user's guess matches the actual sum of the dice, and a cheeky, "no dice" statement if the guess does not match.
